I am Mohammad Javad Saeedizade. I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at Linköping University under the supervision of [Eva Blomqvist](https://www.evablomqvist.se/). My research is at the intersection of NLP and Knowledge Graphs (form AI prospectives: Ontology using LLMs, Ontology Evaluation, Noise removal, etc.). If you have an interesting idea in my research interests, shoot me an email to work on it together.

Education
======
**Master of Artificial Intelligence** <br>
In 2019, I was accepted to the [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST or علم و صنعت)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). My supervisor was [Dr. Minaei-Bidgoli](http://minaei.iust.ac.ir/) in the [NLP lab](http://dml.iust.ac.ir/). Lab projects are about Knowledge Graphs and NLU; I worked in the [Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-knowledge-graph-embedding-with-dgl-ke-77ace6fb60ef) team.  My master's thesis was Knowledge Graph Refinement under the supervision of [Behrouz Minaei Bidgoli](http://minaei.iust.ac.ir/). <br>
My GPA in the last two years was 92%.

**Bachelor of Computer Engineering** <br>
In 2014, I was accepted to [Qom University](http://old.qom.ac.ir/portal/home/?3522/English-Portal). In the first two years, I started learning and searching for my passion in computer fields, and in my third year, I spent all my time learning web and database design. Then, after taking natural language processing and data mining courses in the fourth year, I became interested in artificial intelligence and decided to continue my studies in this field. Also, I and completed my bachelor's project in the Data Mining Laboratory.
My GPA in the last two years was 82%.
