I am Mohammad Javad Saeedizade. I am finished my master of computer artificial intelligence at [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). My master thesis was Knowledge Graph Refinement under the supervision of [Behrouz Minaei Bidgoli](http://minaei.iust.ac.ir/). <br>

Education
======
**Master of Artificial Intelligence** <br>
In 2019, I was accepted to the [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). IUST is ranked 551- 600 in QS and four in Iran in 2020. My supervisor was [Dr. Minaei-Bidgoli](http://minaei.iust.ac.ir/) in the [NLP lab](http://dml.iust.ac.ir/). Lab projects are about Knowledge Graphs and NLU; I worked in the [Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-knowledge-graph-embedding-with-dgl-ke-77ace6fb60ef) team.

**Bachelor of Computer Engineering** <br>
In 2014, I was accepted to [Qom University](http://old.qom.ac.ir/portal/home/?3522/English-Portal). In the first two years, I started learning and searching for my passion in computer fields, and in my third year, I spent all my time learning web and database design. Then, after taking natural language processing and data mining courses in the fourth year, I became interested in artificial intelligence and decided to continue my studies in this field. Also, I and completed my bachelor's project in the Data Mining Laboratory.
My GPA in last two years was 82%.

Research Interests
======
My primary research interest is [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and machine learning with graphs. Most of the university work and research that I did was in this field. For example, my thesis and two papers are about representation learning on [knowledge graph completion](https://paperswithcode.com/task/knowledge-graph-completion). In addition, I love [representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning) and [graph algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). My secondary research interest is [NLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding). I am passionate about several NLP tasks, from text processing, [information extraction (IE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction), and [summarisation](http://nlpprogress.com/english/summarization.html) to complicated tasks like reasoning on graphs. Lastly, I like to make ML algorithms more robust to noise and attack to be more accurate when predicting even out of distribution.

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
