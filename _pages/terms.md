## KGRefiner1
KGRefiner is a novel refining method for refining knowledge graphs. This method helps link prediction algorithms outperform by using hierarchical information in knowledge graphs. Paper: [KGRefiner: Knowledge Graph Refinement for Improving Accuracy of Translational Link Prediction Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14233.pdf).


## Inferable Persian Knowledge Graph
Graph I worked on the Persian knowledge graph. The original graph was not inferable; therefore, no link prediction and triple classification methods could infer on them. I developed several algorithms to prune the graphs. As a result, Farsbase107k392R is created from Farsbase. (comming soon)

## Hadware Limited OpenKE
OpenKE is a widely used framework for link prediction. It does
not work on Google Colab due its time execution limits. I made pause and continue script for
OpenKE so everyone can extract knowledge even on big graphs with Colab.The repository is on
Github.

## Knowledge Graph Generator
I was a part of a project related to generating a knowledge graph
from the raw Persian text in Shahid Beheshti University. Since I am experienced with knowledge
graphs, I proposed a way of generating graphs by NER and other existing graphs.

## Predicting the Popularity of News Topics on the Tabnak News Website
As my bachelorâ€™s
final thesis, I developed a software to predict the popularity of different news categories. This
web-based software extracts various news from a news website every day and shows users the
number of changes in views and popularity of topics in the form of a dashboard.
